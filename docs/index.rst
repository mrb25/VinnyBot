VinnyBot
==============

Vinny is an under development discord bot created by Kikkia. Since Vinny is under current development, Vinny may rarely crash or drop offline for short periods of time as I find/fix bugs and add features. Vinny offers a wide set of features for any discord server. Including Music, Memes, Comment generation, and Much more. For a full list type '~help' in a channel vinny is in. Vinny uses the Discord.py framework, as well as voice with JDA and lavaplayer.
